**Hostel Library Management System**  <br>

This Python-based program is designed to streamline the workflow of a hostel librarian by offering two main functionalities:  <br>
1. **Book Data Management**:  <br>
   - A data entry system to store and manage detailed records of books available in the library.<br>  
   - Includes information such as book name, author, cost, total pages, and stock status.  <br>
2. **Customer Section**:  
   - Dedicated functionality to maintain records of college students who borrow books.  <br>
   - Tracks details like the borrower's name, book borrowed, and other necessary information for efficient library management.  <br>
This system uses **CSV** files for data storage, **MySQL** for advanced database operations, and **prettytable** for presenting information in a clean, tabular format.<br> The program makes routine library tasks simpler and more organized, ensuring seamless management of both book inventory and student borrowing records.<br><br>
