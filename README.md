![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*Ap-YOlRyg7PhK_mHJO_shQ.gif)<br>

This **Python**-based program is designed to streamline the workflow of a hostel librarian by offering two main functionalities: 
1. **Book Data Management**: 
   - A data entry system to store and manage detailed records of books available in the library.
   - Includes information such as book name, author, cost, total pages, and stock status. 
2. **Customer Section**:  
   - Dedicated functionality to maintain records of college students who borrow books. 
   - Tracks details like the borrower's name, book borrowed, and other necessary information for efficient library management.
     
This system uses **CSV** files for data storage, **MySQL** for database operations, and **prettytable** for presenting info in a clean, tabular format.<br> The program makes routine library tasks simpler and more organized, ensuring seamless management of both book inventory and student borrowing records.<br><br>
